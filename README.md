# My First Flutter App ðŸ‘‹

A simple personal profile card built with Flutter. This was my first project after learning Dart, built to practice basic widget composition, state management, and styling.

## What I Practiced
- Using `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`
- Layout with `Column`, `Row`, and `Container`
- Managing state with `setState()`
- Network images with `CircleAvatar`
- Theming and basic styling

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Run `flutter run -d chrome` to launch the app on the web.
